GOT.py is the base version that meets all specified criteria.

GOT_extended.py is as you might've guessed, the extended version. Mindblow.
It also offers a peak into the previous code structure of GOT.py.
We realized it didn't make the slightest sense to have a class include the whole code...
We didn't bother fixing it in the extended version, assuming that the base version is enough for the grade.
